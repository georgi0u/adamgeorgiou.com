    <h1>Hormones Vocab</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Leptin   - Controls a number of metabolic processes. High the better.</li>
      <li>Insulin  - Slows down the processing of fatty acids. The lower the better.</li>
      <li>Ghrelin  - Hunger hormone. Tells you when it's time to eat. Train the timing of this.</li>
      <li>Cortisol - Stress hormone. Produced from huge calorie deficits and extreme workouts. Associated with belly fat storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Prescribed Plan</h1>

    <p>Don't maintain extreme calorie deficits. 
      Eat to fuel your workout, and still be in the negative.
      Maintain a deficit but keep it reasonable.</p>

    <p><strong>Plan</strong> cheat meals to keep leptin high.</p>

    <p>Cyclical carbohydrate fasting.</p>

    <p>Sleep. Ghrelin increases when you lack sleep, which makes you want to eat; and raises cortisol, which is associated with fat storage. w</p>
